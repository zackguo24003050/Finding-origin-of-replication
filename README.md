# Finding-origin-of-replication 

#This is a practise python code for me to identify the origin of replication 

#First I try to find the most frequent pattern, which is likely to have different meaning than others.

#I aslo try to count different pattern 

#After that, I find the revserve complement of it, proving that it is not due to randomness.
