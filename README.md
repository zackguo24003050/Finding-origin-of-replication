# Finding-origin-of-replication 

#This is a practise python code for me to identify the origin of replication 

#First I try to find the most frequent pattern, which is likely to have different meaning than others.

#After that, I find the revserve complement of it, proving that it is not due to randomness.

#I also find the position of specific pattern on the genome.
